Tools Used: 

 RProgramming Language:
 ● R serves as the primary programming language for data analysis and
 visualization.
 ● It provides a rich ecosystem of packages for statistical computing, data
 manipulation, and visualization.

 
 ❖ Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
 ● RStudio is the preferred IDE for this project.
 ● RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for writing, executing, and debugging
 Rcode.

 
 ❖ Ergast API:
 ● The Ergast API (http://ergast.com/mrd/) is the primary data source for F1 race
 data.
 ● It provides historical race data, including race results, pit stops, circuit
 information, and more.

 
 ❖ RPackages:
 ● ggplot2: Used for creating visually appealing and informative plots and graphs.
 18
● dplyr: Provides tools for data manipulation and transformation, including
 filtering, summarizing, and joining datasets.
 ● httr: Enables HTTP requests to fetch data from the Ergast API.
 ● jsonlite: Used for parsing JSON data received from the Ergast API.
 ● shiny: Allows for the creation of interactive web applications to visualize F1 data.

Workflow:
 ❖ DataCollection:
 ● Theproject fetches data from the Ergast API using the httr package.
 ● Various endpoints of the Ergast API are utilized to collect race results, pit stop
 information, circuit data, and more.

 
 ❖ DataProcessing and Analysis:
 ● Dataprocessing and analysis are performed using the dplyr package.
 ● The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to derive meaningful
 insights.

 
 ❖ Visualization:
 ● Visualizations are created using the ggplot2 package.
 ● Bar plots, scatter plots, line plots, and other visualizations are used to present the
 analyzed data effectively.

 
 ❖ Interactive Web Application:
 ● The project may include an interactive web application developed using the shiny
 package.
 ● The Shiny framework allows users to explore and interact with visualized data
 dynamically.
